Notes:
Currently the files are standalone files, fully functional.  The Goal is to make a library that can be dropped in the arduino library folder with an example on how to use the code.  (Working on it)

Any help from others is welcome

ToDo:
1. Add open hardware license to EAGLE files
2. Create *.h and *.cpp and keywords.txt files for library
3. Update Website with more details and videos

Change Log:
4/8/14  First commit, arduino code files, EAGLE board files.
4/9/14  Added license file, description to individual files
